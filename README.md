# BaseStationAssistedD2D
Base Station Assisted D2D communication

The aim of the project:
1. To make a Base station assisted network model where android devices can be grouped into small groups by the base station
2. When the devices in the group request for small file, instead of sending the redundant files to all the devices, Base station 
  send certain distinct parts to the group members and from thereon the member devices will sahre the parts among themselves
   using wifi direct.
   
There are two parts for this project, one at the server side (Base Station ) and one at the Mobile devices side.
